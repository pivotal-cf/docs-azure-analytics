This document describes the Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Microsoft [Operations Management Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/) (OMS) is Microsoft's cloud-based IT management solution that helps you manage and protect your on-premises and cloud infrastructure.

Azure [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/log-analytics/) is a service in OMS that helps you collect and analyze data generated by resources in your cloud and on-premises environments. This document refers to the Azure Log Analytics service in OMS as _OMS Log Analytics_.

The Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics receives logs and metrics from the Loggregator [Firehose](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/loggregator-architecture.html#firehose), filters and resolves the events, and then pushes the events to OMS Log Analytics via the HTTPS Data Collector API.

VMware Tanzu developers and operators can then view and analyze their application logs and health metrics through the OMS portal or the Azure portal.
