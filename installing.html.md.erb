## <a id='create-cf-user'></a> Create a CF User Account

Create a Cloud Foundry (CF) user account with access to the Firehose and Cloud Controller. The Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics service uses this account to retrieve log data.

1. Install the User Account and Authentication command-line interface (`uaac`), if you have not already:
<pre class="terminal">$ gem install cf-uaac</pre>

1. Log into the CF Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) as user `admin`:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf login -a https<span>:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u admin -p UAA-ADMIN-CREDENTIALS-SECRET</pre>

1. Target your system with the `uaac`:
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac target https<span>:</span>//uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</pre>

1. Authenticate and obtain an access token for the admin client from the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server:
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client get admin -s UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-CREDENTIALS-SECRET</pre>

1. Create a CF user account:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-user FIREHOSE-USER FIREHOSE-USER-PASSWORD</pre>

1. Add the new user to the Cloud Controller Admin Read-Only group or Cloud Controller Admin group:
  * For Elastic Runtime v1.9.x and later:
    <pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add cloud\_controller.admin\_read\_only FIREHOSE-USER</pre>
  * For Elastic Runtime v1.8.x:
    <pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add cloud\_controller.admin FIREHOSE-USER</pre>

1. Add the new user to the Doppler Firehose group:
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add doppler.firehose FIREHOSE-USER</pre>


## <a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics

1. Download the product file from [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/azure-nozzle/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics. This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics** tile.

1. In the **Nozzle Config** pane, fill in configuration options as follows:
    1. **OMS Workspace ID**: Enter the OMS workspace ID from the [Create an OMS Workspace](#create-oms) step.
    1. **OMS Workspace Key**: Enter the OMS workspace key from the [Create an OMS Workspace](#create-oms) step.
    1. **OMS Nozzle Instance Number**: Enter the number of nozzle instances. See [the Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/nozzle-for-microsoft-azure-log-analytics/#1-scaling-nozzle) on how to scale the nozzle.
    1. **OMS Post Timeout**: Specify the HTTP post timeout for sending events to OMS Log Analytics. Default is 10s.
    1. **OMS Batch Time**: Specify the interval for posting a batch of messages to OMS Log Analytics. Default is 10s.
    1. **Max Event Number Per Batch**: Specify the maximum number of messages in a batch. Default is 1000.
    1. **Azure Resource ID**: Enter the Resource ID of the Azure resource to associate the data with. That allows the data to be included in resource-context queries. If this field isn't specified, the data will not be included in resource-context queries.
    1. **Firehose Username**: Enter the name of the user that you created in the [Create a CF User Account](#create-cf-user) step.
    1. **Firehose User Password**: Enter the password of the user that you created in the [Create a CF User Account](#create-cf-user) step.
    1. **Cloud Foundry API Address**: Enter the API URL of the VMware Tanzu environment, or leave it empty to let the nozzle fetch from current environment. e.g. `https://api.203.0.113.0.xip.io`.
    1. **Cloud Foundry Doppler Address**: Enter the URL of the Loggregator Traffic Controller, or leave it empty to let the nozzle fetch from current environment. e.g. `wss://doppler.203.0.113.0.xip.io:443`.

    1. **App Space Whitelist**: A comma separated list functioning as a white list for logs and metrics from applications. When left empty, all apps will be monitored. Format for each element in the list should be ORG_NAME.SPACE_NAME or ORG_NAME.*
    1. **Idle Timeout**: Specify the keep-alive duration for the Firehose consumer. Default is 60s.
    1. **Log Event Count**: Enable this option to log the total count of events that the nozzle receives, sends and loses, to OMS Log Analytics as `CounterEvents`.
    1. **Log Event Count Interval**: The time interval for logging event count to OMS Log Analytics. Default is 60s.
    1. **App Info Caching Interval**: How long to cache app names and other metadata. Default is 60s. If the load on the CF API Server is too high, increase the interval.

## <a id='solution'></a> Import Default Solution for Cloud Foundry to Your OMS Portal

Microsoft has provided a default solution for Cloud Foundry including default views, alerts, and saved searches. You can simply import the solution rather than building them yourself.
