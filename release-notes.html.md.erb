## <a id="ver-4-0-1"></a> v4.0.1

**Release Date:** Feb 17, 2022

Features included in this release:

* bumped golang to 1.17

## <a id="ver-4-0-0"></a> v4.0.0

**Release Date:** Sept 20, 2021

Features included in this release:

* Improve nozzle performance, both in ingress and data caching.
  * Nozzle drops envelopes when it is unable to process them effectively for any reason. This is reported as a metric sent to Azure as `nozzle.stats.eventsDropped`.
* Increase reliability by reconnecting to Traffic Controller on failures.

## <a id="ver"></a> v3.0.0

**Release Date:** June 23, 2021

Features included in this release:

* Include the `x-ms-AzureResourceId` header in post requests to the azure log handling service.
* App metadata is no longer cached indefinitely, which can lead to stale data.  The new caching interval is configurable.

### <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

* App names and other metadata are now cached on an interval. The **App Info Caching Interval** is configurable. Configuring an app metadata caching interval that is too short can result in higher CF API load. We recommend monitoring the load and increasing this interval as needed.

**Release Date:** December 3, 2020

Features included in this release:

* Bump ubuntu-xenial stemcell to version 621

### <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

* With this release the product slug has changed to `azure-nozzle`. If you have setup automation to
  download this tile from Tanzu Network please ensure it is now downloading from the new product
  location.
* The `event_filter` tile property that specifies the envelope types to be filtered out has been
  renamed to `envelope_filter` and changed from a comma-separated string to a `multi_select_options`.
  Automation that configures this property will need to be updated.
