This document describes the Microsoft Azure Log Analytics Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Microsoft [Operations Management Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/) (OMS) is Microsoft's cloud-based IT management solution that helps you manage and protect your on-premises and cloud infrastructure.

Azure [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/log-analytics/) is a service in OMS that helps you collect and analyze data generated by resources in your cloud and on-premises environments. In this document, it will be referred to as OMS Log Analytics.

The Microsoft Azure Log Analytics Nozzle for PCF receives logs and metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, filters and resolves the events, and then pushes the events to OMS Log Analytics via the HTTPS Data Collector API.

Developers and operators can view their application logs and health metrics through the OMS portal or the Azure portal.
